## Java Data Types

### primitive data types

A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods

|                      | Data Type | Size    | Description                            |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Integer Types        | byte      | 1 byte  | Stores wholes numbers from -128 to 127 |
|                      | short     | 2 bytes | from -32768 to 32767                   |
|                      | int       | 4 bytes | from                                   |
|                      | long      | 8 bytes |                                        |
| Floating point types | float     | 4 bytes |                                        |
|                      | double    | 8 bytes |                                        |
| Booleans             | boolean   | 1 bit   |                                        |
| Characters           | char      | 2 bytes |                                        |

### Non-primitive data types



| primitive types                                       | Non-primitive types                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| are predefined (already defined) in Java              | are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java(except for String) |
| cannot                                                | can be used to call methods to perform certain operations    |
| A primitive type has always a value,                  | can be null                                                  |
| A primitive type starts with a lowecase letter        | starts with an uppercase letter                              |
| The size of a primitive type depends on the data type | non-primitive types have all the same size.                  |
|                                                       |                                                              |
